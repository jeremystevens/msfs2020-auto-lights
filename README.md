## 🔧 About

**MSFS Auto Lights** is a co-pilot-style lighting automation tool for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. It intelligently manages your aircraft’s interior and exterior lights based on in-game conditions such as altitude, time of day, and whether you're airborne or on the ground.

## ✨ Features

- **Landing Lights** – Automatically toggles when climbing above or descending below 10,000 feet.
- **Exterior Lights** – Turns on/off based on day/night detection.
- **Interior (Cabin) Lights** – Syncs to real-time lighting conditions for enhanced realism.
- *More automation features coming soon!*

> ⚠️ **Note:** This program is **not** intended for manual light control. Enabling it may interfere with your in-game ability to manually toggle aircraft lights. Disable the script if you prefer full manual control.
